Whack-a-mol Game

Purpose:

The goal of the game is to click on as many images that appear as possible.  Every successfully clicked image gets you 1 point and each game lasts a total of 30 seconds.  If you are able to reach 15 points in a game, you win!

Behind the scenes:

This game was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery.  

Depending on whether you win or lose the game, different music will play.  

Using JQuery, a “whack” sound will play every time you click.

CSS animation and styling features create the floating islands and background you see in the game.
